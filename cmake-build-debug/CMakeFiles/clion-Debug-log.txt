CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2" with any of
  the following names:

    SDL2Config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SDL2"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
